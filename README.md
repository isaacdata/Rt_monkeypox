## Abstract

As of August 13, 2022, 2849 cases of monkeypox have been reported in Brazil. We analyzed the four states with the highest incidence and estimated an upward trend between 43.9% and 98.1%. We calculated that, after 20 days since the monkeypox introduction, reproductive numbers remained above 1.7.
